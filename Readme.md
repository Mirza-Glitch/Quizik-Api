## Error Handling

If any error occurs in API requests then it give status 400 with following JSON schema:

```javascript
{
  success: false,
  message: "error message reason" (optional),
  error: "actual error message",
}
```
Remember that error will always give success as false so you may handle it easily on frontend by checking `if(!success){ //handle it }` in if else conditions. Error may occur if there is no data available to delete or update in the database, or if you've provided more than 15 questions or less than 3 questions, or if you've provided less than 2 options or more than 4 options in the questions while doing post or update request, or you'll see any other error reason in `message` if the reason is available.

## Conclusion

You can easily use this API to control Quizzes of Quizik website, you can the full admin access to database. Unlike the Quizik website where users are allowed to create only one quiz per day, using this API you can overcome that limitations. You can actually created unlimited quizzes/update/delete quizzes. But however remember that deleting a quiz won't delete it's results, example of you had a quiz at `/quiz/myquizid` and you deleted it then it won't delete results available on `/results/myquizid`. Note that This API doesn't provide access to results of the quiz. You cannot play with quiz results. If you have other issues regarding this API then feel free to make a pull request.
